Greetings, fellow hitchhiker.
You just stumbled my blog.
This is a random collection of articles I write whenever I feel like it.

# But why, though?

- I am a strong believer in the Free software community.
  As part of it, I want to share my knowledge with the community to help others rise and accomplish their dreams.
- In order for an article to be of any use for other people, the content has to be easily comprehensible.
  The process of writing forces me to think about a problem in a structured way so that you have a chance to understand it.

# Feel free to contact me

If you have your own thoughts on a topic I wrote about and want to discuss it, feel free to reach out to me.
