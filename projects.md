# Beagle

This project aims to help life scientists in managing their data - like a personal Google for your scientific data.
It is the place where I apply newly learned skills to a real-world project.
You can find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/peri4n/beagle)

# My Dev Environment

Notorious for being a productivity nerd, it comes naturally that I care a lot about my development setup.
I have customized my:

* Shell
* Editor (NeoVim)
* Window Manager
* Email setup
* [Keyboard](https://github.com/peri4n/qmk_firmware)

Additionally applying all the customizations is automated using Ansible scripts.

# This Blog

In case you haven't already noticed, this site is generated my yet another static site generator.
The one I use is called [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
This not only allows me to learn a little bit about Haskell but also to fully customize the features of this blog.
