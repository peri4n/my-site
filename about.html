    Hi folks, this is me, Fabian. I am a software developer at <a href="http://www.datameer.com">Datameer</a>, hobby gardener and fulltime dad.
</p>

<p>
    In a previous life I was a data scientist working in academia but left when I realised how deeply screwed science is and never look back.
    Still my interests remain in working with large data sets, functional programming and network security.
</p>

<p>
    If you feel like contacting me, twitter and github, are good places to start.
