Hi folks, this is me, Fabian. I am a software developer at [Datameer](https://www.datameer.com), nerd, hobby gardener, and full-time dad.

In a previous life, I was a data scientist working in academia but left when I realized how deeply screwed science is; I never looked back.
Still, my interests remain in working with large data sets, functional programming, and security.
In particular:

# Languages

* Scala
* Haskell
* Python/R (There in no data science without it.)

# Technologies

* Spark/Hadoop
* Kubernetes/Docker
* Amazon Web Services

I write about the problems I face in my day-to-day life and how I solved them.
I hope this proves to be useful for you and the rest of the internet.
