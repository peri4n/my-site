Hi folks, this is me, Fabian. I am a software developer at [Datameer](http://www.datameer.com), nerd, hobby gardener and fulltime dad.

In a previous life I was a data scientist working in academia but left when I realised how deeply screwed science is and never looked back.
Still my interests remain in working with large data sets, functional programming and network security.

In my blog I write about problems I face in my day-to-day life and how I solved them. I hope this proves to be usefull for you and the rest of the
internet.
