Hi folks, this is me, Fabian. I am a software developer at [Datameer](https://www.datameer.com), nerd, hobby gardener, and full-time dad.

In a previous life, I was a data scientist working in academia but left when I realized how deeply screwed science is; I never looked back.
Still, my interests remain in working with large data sets, functional programming, and security.
In particular:

# Languages

* [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
* [Python](https://python.org)/[R](https://r-project.org) (There in no data science without it.)

# Technologies

* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org)/[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[Docker](https://docker.com)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)

I write about the problems I face in my day-to-day life and how I solved them.
I hope this proves to be useful for you and the rest of the internet.
